# GSoC 2022: pgmoneta, Write-Ahead Log (WAL) infrastructure

This project aims to integrate the PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Log (WAL) data structures into pgmoneta.

I will work on this project by:
1. Study the PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Log (WAL) format
2. Replace usage of pg_receivewal inside pgmoneta with a pgmoneta native solution
3. Create a foundation for a pgmoneta library that can be used for WAL interaction

For more information, please look at my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KKKDU6iP0GOkAMSdGRyxFJRgW964JFVROnpKkbzWyNw/edit#).

# GSoC TimeLine

**Jun 13 - Jun 24**
- [x] Setup development environment
- [x] Compile pgmoneta
- [x] Explore pgmoneta code baseÂ 

**Jun 20 - Jul 1**
- [ ] Study the PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Log (WAL) format
  
* Pgmoneta is a backup/restore solution for PostgreSQL. 
Currently, it uses pg_receivewal to stream the write-ahead log from a running PostgreSQL cluster. Pg_receivewal is called a binary from within pgmoneta. 

* I will replace that call with a native solution that uses the streaming protocol to get the WAL from the server. 

* When implementing the code, I will look into pg_receivewal and come up with my own native solution. 

* Also, pg_receivewal does not acknowledge reply, so I will try to fix this with the native solution.
